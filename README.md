To implement an incremental data load for the Employee table using SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services) and the Lookup tool, you can follow this step-by-step procedure. The idea is to transfer only new or updated records from the source to the destination while avoiding duplication.
________________________________________
Step-by-Step Procedure
1. Prerequisites
•	Source Table: This contains the data you want to load incrementally.
•	Destination Table: The Employee table in your database that you want to update incrementally.
•	Change Tracking Mechanism: Use a column (e.g., Employee ID which is primary key column) in the source to track changes, or compare the whole row if this column is not available.
________________________________________
2. Create the SSIS Package
1.	Create a New SSIS Project: Open Visual Studio and create a new SSIS package.
2.	Add Connection Managers:
o	Create connection managers for the source and destination databases.
3.	Data Flow Task:
o	Drag a Data Flow Task to the Control Flow canvas and double-click it to configure the data flow.

3. Data Flow Task Configuration
1.	Source Component:
o	Add a OLE DB Source and configure it to fetch data from the source table.
2.	Lookup Transformation: Use the Lookup tool to compare incoming data with existing records in the destination table.
o	Configure Lookup Transformation:
	Connect the source output to the Lookup transformation.
	Set the connection to the destination database.
	Use EmployeeID (Primary Key) as the matching column between source and destination.
o	Set Lookup Cache Mode: Choose "Full Cache" for small datasets or "Partial Cache" for large datasets.
o	Specify Columns: Retrieve EmployeeID and relevant columns from the destination table.
3.	Configure Lookup Outputs:
o	Match Output:
	Rows found in the destination table (matches) can be used to check for updates.
o	No Match Output:
	Rows not found in the destination table (new records) are directed to an insert path.
